# Collections-Set-Map

## Collections

Most major programming languages have several types of data collections.
Python has lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Java has lists, sets, maps, queues.
Ruby has hashes and arrays. JavaScript, up until now, had only arrays.
Objects and arrays were the workhorses of JavaScript. ES6 introduces four new data structures
that will add power and expressiveness to the language: Map, and Set

## Map

Map is similar to objects in JavaScript that allows us to store elements of any type in a key/value pair.

<ul>
  <li>A Map object iterates its elements in insertion order.</li>
  <li>Better performance</li>
  <li>Keys can have any data type</li>
  <li>Easy to iterate</li>
  <li>Easy to compute size</li>
  <li>Use when you simply need to map key to values</li>
  <li>Use when you need keys that are not strings</li>
</ul>
